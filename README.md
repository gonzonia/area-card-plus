# area-card-plus

#### An Area card for your Home Assistant Dashboard
This card is heavily inspired by the default area card and the work of [@Dwains](https://github.com/dwainscheeren). <br>
I always thought the area card has so much more potential so i made my own one.

The card will show all entities/devices grouped into domains or device classes that are linked to your area. <br>
To make sure this card will work like it should please check if your relevant entities are assigned to the correct domain.

## Overview

### Card Features

- based on default HA area card with more features and customization
- shows toggle domains (the ones on the right) which can be toggled to on/off
- shows alert entities (motion, door, window) next to toggle domains
- shows sensor entities (temperatur, humidity etc.) under the area icon
- shows climate entities under the sensor entities

## Popup View

The popup view will show all entities/devices that are assigned to the area.
All cards will be shown as a default tile card with some having tile card features enabled.

Below are some screenshots that show what can be done.

    card: |-
      type: custom:mushroom-light-card    # change card type to the card you want
      show_brightness_control: true       # use optional card features (not everything tested)
      show_color_control: true
      show_color_temp_control: true
