# Overview

An **Area Card** for your Home Assistant Dashboard

I always thought the area card has so much more potential so i made my own one. <br>
The card will show all entities/devices grouped into domains or device classes that are linked to your area. <br>
To make sure this card will work like it should please check if your relevant entities are assigned to the correct domain.

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). So now you can use this great idea as a single card in all of your Dashboards

 - ‚úÖ **Based on entity states** - Shows entities that are in a on/active state
 - üìö **Automatic Grouping** - Entities grouped by domain/device_class
 - üìë **Popup View** - Entities will render as Tile Cards in a new view
 - üß† **GUI Editor** - No code or scripts needed
 - üîß **Highly customizable** - almost everything customizable
 - üì± **Optimized for desktop and phones**
 - üåç **Available in all HA languages**

## Popup View

The popup view will show all entities/devices that are assigned to the area.
All cards will be shown as a default tile card with some having tile card features enabled.

#### Change tap_action, double_tap action, hold_action icon or color
You can choose between the default HA actions [more-info, toggle, navigate, URL, perform-action, nothing] <br>
Toggle will toggle all entities of the clicked domain assigned to your area, more-info will show all entities of the clicked domain. <br>
Evenrything else has default behavior. <br>
You can select an individual icon & color for each domain if you want

### Change card in the popup view
This feature is experimental and YAML only (for now)

Add this code

```yaml
customization_popup:  
  - type: light                           # change it to the domain you want
    card: |-
      type: custom:mushroom-light-card    # change card type to the card you want
      show_brightness_control: true       # use optional card features (not everything tested)
      show_color_control: true
      show_color_temp_control: true
      use_light_color: true
```
### Changing CSS for some items
You can change most things like icon, name of area and alert/toggle domains (border, color, size etc.)
