# status-card

A status card for home assistant dashboard

This is my first custom card for Home Assistant.
I am not a coder and have no background in coding. I always tried to achieve something like this with different approaches but nothing was the way in wanted to.
So i tried a bit and i was able to create my own custom card.

This card i highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard).
I tried to to have this in every dashboard i want and dont want to be restricted by Dwains Dashboard.

I also made some tweaks so it has some more functions.
I added a graphical Interface to edit the card. Everything is managable from GUI :)

# Features
 - shows person entities
 - shows all entities which aren't off grouped by domain or deivce class
 - filter for areas/floors
 - customization of domains and device classes
 - can show extra entities
 - you can hide certain entities
 - graphical editor
 - should work in all available HA languages

# How does it work?

This card shows every person entity which is present in your HA environment. You can also disable that person entities will be shown.
Also this card goes through a bunch of domains and device classes and looks for the state of all entities inside them.

If the entity is on, home or open (or something else which isn't off) it will show up in the card.
Please keep attention that it will only show entities which are linked to any area. Without this it would be a mess.

# Screenshots
### Graphical Editor

### Area/Floor & Label Filter
Use this to only show entities linked to an area/floor. You can combine this with the Label Filter. Only entities with this label will be shown. Area/Floor can be combined with the Label Filter.

### Adding Extra Entities
Choose an extra Entity which you want to see in your status card. Choose the entity, after that you can pick the state and choose an icon and color to show it. You can also change the sort order to display it somewhere else in the card.

## Customization of Domains or Device Classes
You can specify the look of the domains and device classes. You can change the icon, icon color and sort order. You can also completly hide them and now you can invert them. If you only want to show closed garage, doors or locks for example.

## Hiding Names for Person, Domains, Device Classes & Extra Entities

## More Info View
For Extra Entities you have the default More Info View for your entity. If you click on a group (domain/deviceclass) you will get a list of all entities in the desired state.

You can set the columns of entities next together from 1 to 4 with this:

so it will look like this:

## Bulk Mode
Bulk Mode will list all entities instead of showing entity cards. You can use this to have a quick access to copy all unwanted entities and paste them into hidden_entities via yaml.
