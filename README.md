This is a fork of the Area Card Plus created by <a href="https://github.com/xbourner">xbourner</a>. I wanted to add cusom buttons with ability to execute scripts and launch scenes. This also turned into the ability execute JS so that a script could be launched and  the dashboard changed from a single click. This write up is a slightly modified version of what <a href="https://github.com/xbourner">xbourner</a> wrote on the main README.

The fork was developed with the assistance of AI tools. I found Claude to be the best at generating working code.

# Overview

An **Area Card** for your Home Assistant Dashboard

@xbourner always thought the area card has so much more potential so they made their own one. <br>
The card will show all entities/devices grouped into domains or device classes that are linked to your area. <br>
To make sure this card will work like it should please check if your relevant entities are assigned to the correct domain.

This card is highly influenced by [Dwains Dashboard](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). So now you can use this great idea as a single card in all of your Dashboards

For more info look at [How to add Custom Repositories](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/)

#### Usage:

After adding the repository to your HA instance you need to add the card to one of your dashboards. <br>
Just choose an area an the card will do the rest. <br>
The card needs to work with your areas so you need to assign your relevant devices/entities to your areas.

### Experimental
This feature is experimental and YAML only (for now)

Add this code

```yaml
customization_popup:  
  - type: light                           # change it to the domain you want
    card: |-
      type: custom:mushroom-light-card    # change card type to the card you want
      show_brightness_control: true       # use optional card features (not everything tested)
      show_color_control: true
      show_color_temp_control: true
      use_light_color: true
```

```yaml
custom_buttons:                          # change it to the icon you want
  - icon: mdi:apple                    
    tap_action:
      action: custom                    # set action to custom to use JS
      custom_code: >                    
        hass.callService('script', 'turn_on', { entity_id:
        'script.livingroomtoggleappletv' }); window.history.pushState(null, '',
        '/a-v-main/living-room-apple'); wind
```

The custom_code field accepts JavaScript as a string. The system takes that string and executes it using JavaScript's Function constructor with a safe execution context. The execution context provides these variables/functions that you can use in your JavaScript:

hass - Full Home Assistant object for service calls, state access, etc.
config - The card's configuration
states - All entity states (hass.states)
entity(entityId) - Helper to get a specific entity state
callService(domain, service, data) - Direct service call helper
navigate(path) - Navigation helper
fireEvent(type, detail) - Custom event helper



#### Animations

Add this (or other animation css code) to your yaml config.

```yaml
card_mod:
  style: |
    @keyframes rotation {
    0% {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    100% {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }}
```

And into one of the icon customizations:

```yaml
animation: rotation 1s linear infinite;
  ```
